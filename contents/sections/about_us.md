## About Healing on the Streets

Healing on the Streets Bromley is a group of ordinary people, from a number of churches and denominations in the Bromley area, who follow Jesus. **We believe God loves everyone and that one of the ways in which He can demonstrate that love is through His power to heal**.

Our aim is to be available, on a regular basis in Bromley High Street, to pray for anyone who asks. We want to do this because we believe that God loves you and wants you to reorder your life around a new reality: Jesus Christ came to Earth and demonstrated His love for you, by dying on the cross and rising from the dead, proving He was God. He wants to give you a chance to start again and healing is one way in which He demonstrates His love for you.

Our story is that Jesus has fulfilled our deepest needs, has forgiven our wrong doing, healed our hurts and has given us hope and a purpose for life through following Him and we believe that the same can be true for you.

So whether it is for you, a family member or a friend, we have a team who are willing to pray with you. This is for anyone who is sick, unwell or suffering from injury. It won't cost you anything except a moment of your time.
