## Who are we?

“Healing on the Streets Bromley” are a group of ordinary people, from a number of churches and denominations in the Bromley area, who follow Jesus. We believe God loves everyone, regardless of circumstances, social-economic background, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, age or faith and, as members of the church, we are keen to demonstrate what those words mean and we believe that one of the ways in which He can demonstrate that love is through His power to heal.

### How did “Healing on the Streets“ start?

“Healing on the Streets” was pioneered by Mark Marx and a Church called the Causeway Coast Vineyard, based in Coleraine, Northern Ireland. It was started at Easter in 2005 and since then a group of Christians have gone out on to the town centre in Coleraine, come rain or shine, and offered to pray for people each week.

The “Healing on the Streets” model has now been adopted by many churches across the UK and around the world with around 110 cities across the UK (including Aberdeen, Birmingham, Derby, Leicester, London, Newcastle, Plymouth, York) hosting a “Healing on the Streets” team. There are also teams in nations across Europe (including Holland, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland) and interest from churches in Asia, Australia, South Africa and the USA.

From these teams have come many stories of people experiencing the love of Jesus, including reports of individuals being healed.

### The “Healing on the Streets Bromley” story

In June 2011 Mark Marx was in Bromley delivering “Healing on the Streets” training at a course run by DNA, a Christian gap year provider.

DNA trainees and leaders from across 7 different churches participated in the training programme and, after the training, a team went in to Bromley High Street where they began by kneeling together in front of the Churchill Theatre and prayed for Bromley. They then offered passers by the opportunity to receive prayer for healing. Around 23 people were prayed for within the space of an hour and many more talked with those handing out literature.

The churches that were involved discovered that “healing on the streets” was a gentle and non-threatening way to express our faith, which demonstrated in a simple way that God loves ordinary people. Those who experienced prayer were genuinely appreciative and thankful.

As a group of church leaders drawn from different backgrounds across Bromley we all acknowledge that God is already doing a great deal in our town and borough for which we are grateful. However, we all also expressed a desire to see God release even more of His love, grace and power in our town and sensed that we would see more of His healing power through working together than by doing things simply on our own. So we agreed to partner together with the Causeway Coast Vineyard in Coleraine and seek to establish a “Healing on the Streets Bromley” team.
