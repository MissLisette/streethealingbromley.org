## When you've received prayer

If you are aware that you have been healed since we prayed with you it would be an honour to hear back from you. Not only will this encourage the team who have prayed with you but we would love to celebrate with you and we want to give God all the honour, because it is by His Power you have received your healing, not by any of us. This is why we do not accept any money or donations for what we do.

There are some very important things that you must consider now.

Firstly, if you are on any medication you MUST STAY on it. No matter how you feel, you should not stop doing anything until your doctor or specialist has advised you.

We are not medically trained, so please go and see your doctor or specialist and explain to them what has occurred and ask them to confirm your healing with any tests that they think necessary. Their verification of your healing will be a great endorsement to others of what God has done.

If you are not aware of your healing, first of all don't worry, God really does still love you. The question you may be asking is "Why haven't I been healed?" Especially if others around you were. There is an example in the bible of someone not being instantly healed so don't be discouraged but let us know so we can pray with you again.

We don't have all the answers. What we do have however is persistence and if you would like us to, we will pray with you again, as many times as it takes.

Some healings aren't instantaneous. Again, we don't have all the answers however we do believe that when we pray, God hears: And when God hears we know He answers.
